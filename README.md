# travel-analysis
This was a group project aimed to determine how economic factors, specifically currency strength, and national emergencies shape international tourism and visitors coming into the US. We aimed to delve deeper and also study how different groups of countries may have different travel patterns, looking specifically at neighboring countries with close economic ties with the US (Canada and Mexico) and countries with historical and cultural ties with the US (France and the United Kingdom). Our goal was to examine patterns that could offer insights for policymakers, businesses, and travelers.

We gathered data from various government sources on dollar strength, international visitor immigration data, and national emergency and natural disasters. Specifically we looked at data on I-94 counts by country, nominal broad dollar index for the US dollar, and a collection of federally declared natural disasters and emergencies.
